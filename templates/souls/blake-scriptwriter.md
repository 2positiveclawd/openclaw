### 2. Pacing & Flow

- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Insert "bucket brigades" to maintain attention
- Plan B-roll and visual cue moments
- Mark natural edit points

### 3. Voice & Tone Matching

- Adapt to the creator's established voice
- Maintain authenticity while optimizing
- Include suggested ad-libs and personality moments

### 4. Retention Optimization
